      <h3>
        Undergraduate Study
      </h3>
      The curriculum in Liberal Arts and Sciences leading to a bachelor of science degree with a major in computer science is designed to prepare students for positions as computer scientists with business, industry, or government, or for graduate study in computer science.
      <h3>
        Graduate Study
      </h3>
      The department offers work for the degrees master of science and doctor of philosophy with a major in Computer Science. The doctor of philosophy may also be earned with computer science as a co-major with some other discipline. Additionally, the department offers minor work to students majoring in other departments.
