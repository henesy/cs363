Succesfully run:

1 Enruo's edu demos (JDBC demos)  (Yes), sometimes the last demo will throw a null-pointer (?) // Use loadStorage 
2 CyDIW_TKDE_demo.txt  (Yes)
3 XMark_Demo.txt   ()
   Problems:
   // Query_03
      Query_07 
   
   Working fine:
      Query-05
      Query-02
4 Jinu's demo (read sequence pages) (Yes)


Going to Run:
 NC94_final Demo (Yes, createbtree has some problem, probably loadstorage command does not work properly)


More demos in this version: 

$CyDB:>loadstorage   ;
